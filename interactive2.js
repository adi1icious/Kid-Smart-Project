The hare was very proud of himself and he asked the tortoise. “Shall we have a race?" The tortoise agreed. They started the running race. The hare ran very fast. But the tortoise walked very slowly. The proud hair rested under a tree and soon slept off. But the tortoise walked very fast, slowly and steadily and reached the goal. At last, the tortoise won the race.`,

The mother dog told the pups, do not go near the well or play around it. One of the pups wondered why they shouldn’t go to the well and decided to explore it. He went to the well. Climbed up the wall and peeked inside. In there, he saw his reflection and thought it was another dog. The pup saw that the other dog in the well (his reflection) was doing whatever he was doing, and got angry for imitating him. He decided to fight with the dog and jumped into the well, only to find no dog there. He barked and barked and swam until the farmer came and rescued him. The pup had learned his lesson.`,
